  ### üìåüìÉ CSS Theory Questions

  ## Q1. What is CSS?
     -  Cascading Style Sheets or CSS, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. It is used to define the layout, formatting, and appearance of web pages.

  ## Q2. How can CSS be integrated into an HTML page?
     -  There are three ways of integrating CSS into HTML:
        - using style tags in the head section 
        - using inline-styling 
        - writing CSS in a separate file, and linking into the HTML page by the link tag. 

  ## Q3. What is the difference between a class and an ID?
     -  Class is a way of using HTML elements for styling. They are not unique and have multiple elements.    Whereas ID is unique and it can be assigned to a single element.

  ## Q4. Name some font-related CSS attributes. 
     -  font-related attributes are Font- style, variant, weight, family, size, etc. 

  ## Q5. What are the limitations of CSS?
     -  The limitations of CSS are:
        - CSS cannot always assure compatibility with every browser; you need to be cautious while choosing the style selector.
        - The parent selector tag is not available, thus you can‚Äôt select the parent selector tag.
        - Some selectors can lead to cross-browser issues due to their less browser-friendly behavior.
        - We cannot request a webpage through CSS. 

  ## Q6. What are selectors?
     -  A selector is a pattern used to select the HTML elements you want to style. It identifies which element in the HTML document will be targeted to apply the specified style rules.
     - It can be element selector, class selector, id selector, attributes selector, pseudo class and pseudo element selector.
    
  ## Q7. What do you mean by pseudo-class and pseudo-element?
     - Pseudo-classes: Pseudo-classes are used to define the special state of an element. They start with a colon (:) followed by the pseudo-class name. It include :- :hover, :active, :focus, :visited etc.
     - Pseudo-elements: Pseudo-elements allow you to style specific parts of an element. They start with two colons (::) followed by the pseudo-element name. It include :- ::before, ::after, :first-line etc.

  ## Q8. Explain responsive web design. 
     - It is a web page creation approach uses flexible images, layouts, and CSS media queries. Aims to build web pages that detect the orientation and screen size of the visitors so that the layout can be changed accordingly.  

  ## Q9. What is VH/VW (viewport height/ viewport width) in CSS?
     - VH and VW are CSS units used to measure viewport height and viewport width respectively in percentage form in the responsive design techniques. 
      E.g. If the height of the browser is 1000px, then VH is 1/100 of the height of the viewport that is 1000px*(1/100) = 10px, which is the height of the browser.  The same applies to VW (viewport width).

  ## Q10. How do you specify units in the CSS? What are the different ways to do it?
     - Px (Pixel) is used for fine-grained control and alignment and not cascade. To get it sharp, we can use 1px or multiple of px.
     - Em is used to maintain relative size and responsive fonts. 1em = 16px having also the same font size. It is advisable to set the font size to 10px in common practice.
     - Pt (point) is a fixed-size unit that is used in print. 1pt = 1/72 inch.
     - Percentage (%) is used to set the font size with respect to the font size of the body. Thus, it is necessary to set the reasonable font size of the body.
